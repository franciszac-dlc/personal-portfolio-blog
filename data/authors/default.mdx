Hey! I'm Francis, a data scientist by title, but a full stack data professional by nature. With over 4 years of experience in the data field, ranging from product analytics, to hypothesis testing, to data engineering, and to machine learning development, I am excited to work on anything with data!

I started off a graduate of UP Diliman, with a BS of Computer Science, before working for a few years and eventually finishing my Master of IT in UNSW, while specializing in Artificial Intelligence. During my studies, I have also done research on fields like mathematical optimization and recommender systems. In general, I carry with me a passion for all things Math and Computer Science.

Currently I work as a data scientist at Freelancer.com Limited, where I have been responsible for a lot of the spam and fraud countermeasures of the company, as well as working on our data pipeline, specifically on graph databases and ML model deployment.
