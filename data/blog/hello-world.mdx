# Preface

Hey, I have a blog now! Now, although I started this blog as a means to build a portfolio to show recruiters and convince them to invite me for interviews (please), I also wanted to nerd out about random topics I encounter in my journey as a data scientist, or engineer, or analyst, or whatever. I wanted to host it myself and maybe pick up a bit about front end development as well, so I’m not posting on Medium (plus I hate subscription paywalls for articles, I get why they exist, I still hate them).

Anyway, my first post will be about something I explored while working on an assignment for university work: simulated annealing! I’ve delved into optimization in the past and these metaheuristic methods always seemed interesting in how they were derived from real-life phenomena, but what I also found interesting is how deep this rabbit hole went! I had no idea there was a whole research field exploring just the _temperature parameter_ of the algorithm. Now, for the next blog post I’ll spare you the details and simply talk about an interesting aside I found while researching the topic, which is how people have integrated this into more popular optimization methods like gradient descent. Look out for that soon!

# Future plans

As I mentioned, this blog will contain my ramblings about my career in the data field, however I may talk a bit about my own hobbies here and there. Right now, my main hobby is making music! I might link my artist profile somewhere sometime in the future, but I may want to separate my professional and hobbyist lifestyles.

Here are some of the topics I plan to talk about in the future:

- Databases like RocksDB and others built on top of that
- Machine learning algorithms and Pytorch
- My current side project involving a data pipeline and NER system (soon...)
- Developer tools like using Docker for running system simulations
- My experience building this blogsite! (I'm not a web developer by trade, so have fun watching me struggle with frontend tech...)

Anyway, I hope you stick around!
